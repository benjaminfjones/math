Mathematics, as well.

I've been sharing code related to mathematical projects on my own homepage since graduate school.
Now I've finally made it into the 2.0 world and starting sharing / hosting my projects on github,
a social coding platform with a lot of awesome features:

  1. my projects are all under version control (using git),

  2. my projects are backed up (on github.com),

  3. my projects are shared with the world (and a very active programming community),

  3. documentation and information sharing is very easy using github's pages feature
     and Jekyll (the static site generator).
