Computational Mathematics Projects
==================================

* Continued Fraction Period for Quadratic Surds (continued_fractions)

> Fast Sage code for computing the period (and pre-period) of
the continued fraction expansion of a quadratic irrational
number.

* Demazure character formula (demazure)

> Computing the Demazure character formula in Sage. This is code
to be contibuted to the combinat/root_system/weyl_character module.

* KPJ Strata (KPJStrata)

> Enumeration of Kraft-Procesi-Johnson strata in the Enhanced
Nilpotent Cone. This project is work in progress.

* Zelevinsky Resolutions and CSM Classes (csm)

> This project contains Sage code for doing combinatorics related
to Zelevinsky Resolutions and computing Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson
classes of Schubert varieties in Grassmanians.
