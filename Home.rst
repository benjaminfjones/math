Computational Mathematics Projects
==================================

 * Continued Fraction Period for Quadratic Surds

	Fast Sage code for computing the perdiod (and pre-period) of
	the continued fraction expansion of a quadratic irrational 
	number.

 * KPJ Strata

	Enumeration of Kraft-Procesi-Johnson strata in the Enhanced
	Nilpotent Cone. This project is work in progress.

 * Zelevinsky Resolutions and CSM Classes

	This project contains Sage code for doing combinatorics related
	to Zelevinsky Resolutions and computing Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson
	classes of Schubert varieties in Grassmanians. See [1]_
