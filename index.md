### Projects ###


* Continued Fraction Period for Quadratic Surds

> Fast Sage code for computing the perdiod (and pre-period) of
> the continued fraction expansion of a quadratic irrational
> number. This project was originally based on the following
> question on [ask.sagemath.org](http://ask.sagemath.org):
> [Continued fraction expansion of quadratic irrationals.][3]

* KPJ Strata

> Enumeration of Kraft-Procesi-Johnson strata in the Enhanced
> Nilpotent Cone. This project is work in progress partially based
> on [this publication][2].

* Zelevinsky Resolutions and CSM Classes

> This project contains Sage code for doing combinatorics related
> to Zelevinsky Resolutions and computing Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson
> classes of Schubert varieties in Grassmanians, see [the publication][1].

### Downloads ###

Each of the projects described above is hosted on
[github.com](http://github.com) at the following location:
[Math Projects Repository][math-repo]. Source code, logs, 
and worksheets can be downloaded either by cloning the git
repository:

<pre class="terminal"><code>$ git clone git://github.com/benjaminfjones/math.git</code></pre>

or by clicking the "Download" button which will give you a
``.tar.gz`` or ``.zip`` file.
